Hosting: 
	The website is hosted at the following IP address http://68.183.117.252/. Since the website is dynamic and hosted via a webserver viewing the webpages locally will not work as the database will not be present.
Description: 
	E-commerce website currently for selling software but can be customized to whatever product needs to be sold. Employs the MVC design model using a mySQL database for the model. HTML, CSS & Javascript for the view that is the website itself and php function objects as the controller.
Folders:
	Public: 
		Here you will find all the public facing webpages i.e webpages that public users should have access to. 
	Private: 
		Here you will find the php scripts that communicate and dynamically displays results onto the webpage. This should not be asscessible by the public so is in a seperate private folder. The private folder contains the functions, database connection information, initialization routines, and global variables.
